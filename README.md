# password-manager-gui
A password manager. Currently in development. (Right now code looks like a terrible mess, i am basically inventing some kind of "framework" on top of Dear PyGui, but I will try to clean it up and document it after finishing this project)

# Install
```
git clone <this repository>
cd password-manager-gui
poetry install
poetry run python main.py
```
